### Added

- Configurations and OntologyTrees dependencies
- A CondaPkg.toml that describes the required dependencies. Also added the env.jl script to resolve the dependencies and update the LocalPreferences.toml file such that RCall understands the R version to use.
- Since this package is intended to be used in a devcontainer, the postCreateCommand was added to the devcontainer.json file to ensure that the environment is set up correctly.
